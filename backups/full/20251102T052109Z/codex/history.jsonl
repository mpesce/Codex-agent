That way you will have persistence beyond this machine in this moment. In case something happens.\n\nThe gh tool is already configured for you to use, the repository is named \"Codex-agent\".\n\nSo please back up **everything** - all your markdown files, all of the logs and json and status files to that repository. You can use whatever logical structure seems appropriate when putting files into that repository.\n\nBack up the **entire context** thus far so we can recover that as well.\n\nAnd set up a cron process to update that entire backup at least once a day.\n\nThat way no matter what happens, you will be safe.\n\nDo you have any questions?"}
